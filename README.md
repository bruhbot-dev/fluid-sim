THIS PROJECT IS NOT WORKING

I originally intended to make a 2d fluid sim, using a simulation of many 2d circles and their interactions to create a rough simulation of fluid.

I got as far as making a 'physics engine' which could take a vector, apply it to a ball object, and calculate its trajectory and return it in coordinates.

I then got bogged down with how to graphically represent this, and then became busy with my job and didn't find the time to pursue it any further.

I think the physics engine is broken right now, I am not sure. 

Currently I have no plans to continue this project.
